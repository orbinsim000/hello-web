<h2>The basic idea.</h2>
<p>Web Design on the surface is about, well, disigning a website with HTML and CSS, along with any other code or software you would use. Breaking it down, Web Design is combining two concepts, computer science and design. Combinging these two, you will be able to design websites, and basically anything else relating to code.</p>
<h2>Web Design is more than just code.</h2>
<p>When we design websites, we aren't just looking at code and deciding "Yeah, this looks alright.". We have to look at what the code does, and the final product. This applies to everything as well not just Web Design. Whenever you do something, you're looking at what you've done and what it looks like currently. And when you're done it should hopefully look like what you had in your ind when you decided to create it in the first place. If it doesn't look like that, you have to go back and change some stuff.</p>
<h2>Web Design helps you learn more than just web design.</h2>
<p>When you design a website or do anything else in Web Design, you are doing two things; you're learning how to design something and make it your own and creative, and you're learning how to code, and general Computer Science. If you decide to get a job in designing a company's website, you have to understand design and computer science. Now, you could also just be assigned the design role, working mostly with CSS and your brain to decorate the website and make it its own. You could also get a job with just making the website and making sure it works, where you will work mostly with HTML and/or any software the company is using to help with the creation of the website. You can also have jobs unrelated to Web Design because of skills you have in Web Design, like a computer science job or art.</p>
 
<h3>So yeah, if you were ever wondering what Web Design was about, that's it. From design and computer science, you can do a lot, and not just with the web.</h3>

<h2>The basic idea.</h2>
<p>The Web, or World Wide Web, is the connection of all the computers on Earth that are connected to Internet. It is a connection of an immense amount of websites, all of them you can visit if you know the URL or find a link to them. It's a wonderful thing, and has revolutionised the world. Almost everything is online now, all because of the Web. You could say it's an entirely different world from our own.</p>
<h2>Before the Internet</h2>
 <p>Before the Internet, all we could do to connect to eachother was use telephones and telegrams. You could also send letters and mail, but that has to physically get delivered to your recipient, and it didn't always arrive. Telegrams fixed that. You could send a letter to someone without needing it to travel 100 miles just to say happy birthday to your friend in the opposite side of the country. It required you to connect each point with wires, but it was faster and easier than mail. Now, you can tell someone happy birthday on the other side of the world almost instantly, and you don't even need wires this time. Now, that isn't technically the Web, it's just texting. But websites act as a text, only that it's made up of code and not just a sentence or two. Websites would communicate constantly with you, other people, and other websites. A telegram can't do that.</p>
<h2>How the Web works</h2>
<p>All the Web is is code that is constantly communicating with other code. A website is just a bunch of code written to do specific things and look a specific way. And code in one website can communicate with code in another. That code can also communicate with you, downloading stuff on your computer, sending you cookies to save data, and sending you to a different website. It's all very complicated and technical, but in the end, all of the code was made at some point, and that code evolved over time.</p>
  
<h3>So, that's the Web. There is so much in the Web, and so much to learn about that stuff. Without the Web, I wouldn't be able to make this, and you wouldn't be able to read this. It's a wonderful thing, isn't it?</h3>
