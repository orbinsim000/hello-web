<a name="The-dough">
<h2>The dough</h2>
<p>Pizza is very interpretive. You can put almost anything on top pizza, and several types of cheese to put on the sauce. Some people don't even eat pizza with the tomato sauce, and some people use different sauces. There are tons of variety, including the crust. But you can't go without the crust. Seriously, you can order pizza without toppings, without cheese, without sauce, or without any of that. But you can NEVER have a pizza without the crust. After all, pizza is a kind of flatbread, and it wouldn't be flatbread without the actual bread. Now, you can change up the types of bread, and put stuff in the bread, but you can never get rid of the bread. So, since it's so important, how was it made? It's complicated, to say the least. We will simplify it here to save time, and to not bore you. Traditional bread is made straight from flour, and traditional flour is made straight from ground grains, and grains come from wheat. Add a bit of water, let it soak in, then you have dough. Knead this dough into a circle, then let it rise. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how the bread was originally made for pizza.</p>
<a name="The-sauce">
<h2>The sauce</h2>
<p>Another traditional pizza topping is tomato sauce. Without tomatoes and tomato sauce, pizza would not be here today. It's also a miracle, since Europeans originally thought tomatoes were poisonous, and if those Italian peasants hadn't used it in their food, we probably would not have many traditional foods served with tomato sauce. However, you might ask, how did they make the sauce? Unlike dough, this one is actually pretty simple. Tomato sauce for pizza now is made from pureed tomatoes that are then seasoned. The peasants, not in access of these spices, probably just mashed the tomatoes like you would potatoes, then removed the seeds.</p>
<a name="The-cheese">
<h2>The cheese</h2>
<p>So, we've talked about the dough, and we've talked about the sauce. Even without the title, you would know what we are talking about next. That's right, we're talking about the cheese, specifically mozzarella cheese. After all, cheese pizza is the vanilla icecream of pizza. So, how is the cheese made? Short answer, like all cheeses, it comes from milk. However, there are many different kinds of milk, and some cheese are treated differently. You probably won't believe me when I say this, but there is a cheese out there that is treated by letting it ferment, with FLY EGGS. That's right, there is a cheese that has live maggots in it, and people actually eat it. So, not all cheeses are the same. That being said, how is mozzarella cheese made? Traditional mozzarella cheese is made from buffaloes' milk, using the normal method of making cheese from milk. I find it hard to milk a buffalo, but that's how it's made. However, modern mozzarella cheese is mostly made from cow's milk. The mozzarella cheese is then shredded and then sprinkled onto the pizza.</p>
