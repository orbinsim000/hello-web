<a name="Why'pizza'">
<h2>Why "pizza"?</h2>
<p>We all know what pizza is. You can't go anywhere without seeing pizza. But, why do we call it pizza? Well, it all started with the Italians. Oh, Italy, the place of tomato sauce and exotic food. What could we do without you? When challenged with naming this amazing invention of flatbread with tomato sauce and cheese with other various toppings and seasonings, the Italians chose pizza, which probably derives off of pizziare, which means "to season".</p>

<h2>How the pizza came to be</h2>
<p>So you know why pizza is called "pizza", but how was is created? The answer may surprise you. Originally, the tomato used to make the tomato sauce of pizza was thought to be poisonous by Europeans, but pizza was created before the Europeans found out it was harmless, so how can this be? The answer is simple: the tomatoes, thought of as poisonous and useless, were given to peasants, and since they couldn't afford much more than these tomatoes and some bread and cheese, they naturally combined the three.In the poor parts of Naples, peasants were making flatbread and topping it with tomato sauce in cheese. This obviously tasted delicious, and spread throughout Italy, and soon into the Americas and other parts of Europe. So, from a peasant's small home in Naples, Italy, to your local Dominoes, that is how the pizza came to be.</p>
<a name="The-business-of-pizza">
<h2>The business of pizza</h2>
<p>Time to get down to the bread and butter, or should I say tomato sauce and cheese, of the business success of pizza. As pizza travelled to the Americas, more specifically the Unites States, it came in force. Italian immigrants everywhere were taking their pizzas with them, and soon the US will be full of pizza. One of the first people to take advantage of the situation was Gennaro Lombardi, who opened one of the first pizzerias in New York City, causing New York to become the hub of pizza that it is today. And almost 40 years later, another person seized the opportunity to make a fortune. They saw how delicious the toppings of pizza were, so naturally they increased the amount of toppings by a lot. Then and there Ike Sewell created the first ever deep-dish pizza, which would become a sort of Americanized version of the classic Italian pizza. Then, someone had the idea of frozen pizza, since Americans are too lazy to make something Italian peasants with much less money could invent. And all the while, new pizza toppings were being created. People were putting tons of different meats and vegetables on pizza, experimenting with different flavors and textures. That, my friend, is how pizza was turned from a peasant's daily meal, into a home-favorite of most Americans.</p>
