<a name=The-crust>
<h2>The crust</h2>
<p>How do restaurants do it? Well, this is the answer. Now, they either import frozen pizza, or make fresh pizza. For our benefit, we will be talking about fresh pizza, and we will also only be talking about the commonly found dough, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese that makes cheese pizza. Now, to get to the crust. Since the flour they are using doesn't have any yeast in it, they shall buy some baker's yeast, specifically 1 tablespoon. Add this yeast to a cup of warm water until it is foamy. Then add 2 cups of sifted flour, along with a tablespoon of olive oil, all into a bowl. The mixture should resemble dough now, and they then knead it for 10 minutes. After that, the dough is formed into a ball, dusted with flour, then placed on a wet towel in a bowl. This is placed in a warm place, and let to sit for 2 hours. Afterwards, the dough is then kneaded once again for about a minute, then placed on a floured surface and  it's edges are squished to make sure none of the toppings spill out. The first step is now complete, on to the tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.</p>

<h2>The sauce and cheese</h2>
<p>Since this is way more simple than the dough, we will also include how the pizza is baked. So after a half cup of tomato sauce is spread over the dough and the shredded mozzarella cheese is sprinkled on top, it's time to bake. Note: while we don't mention any toppings, restaurants sometimes put the uncooked toppings on the pizza and let it bake with the pizza, some restaurants bake the toppings separately and place them on afterwards. On to the baking. The pizza is placed in a pizza pan or a traditional clay stove, then left to bake. The pizza gets up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit in the oven, and is left like this for 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbling. The pizza is then taken out, and left to sit for 5 minutes and is then cut into the appropriate amount of slices with a pizza wheel.</p>
<a name="The-toppings">
<h2>The toppings</h2>
<p>Ah yes, the toppings. There are hundreds of different types of toppings, and they can be literally anything. Find a small food that can be put on pizza? Well don't hesitate, put it on that pizza! There are plenty of meats out there, so cut them up and put on pizza! Vegetables? Put them on pizza as well! Any vegetable! Want a kale/ham hybrid pizza? You can have a kale/ham hybrid pizza! The list goes on and on and on. But, all toppings are put into two categories: do you cook them, or do you not? As said before, you can also put toppings on pizza after it's baked, and specifically all toppings you don't bake are done like this. But, also said before, you can bake toppings separately and put them on the pizza after its baked. So, even more ways of creating a pizza. And we haven't even talked about the different cheeses, sauces, and bread! There are more kinds of pizza in the world than there are atoms in the universe, and that is why pizza is such a magical food. You can serve it however you like.</p>
